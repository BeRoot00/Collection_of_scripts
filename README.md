## Script Collection

This repository contains a collection of scripts that I use for various tasks and projects. Each script is designed to perform a specific task and can be used independently or integrated into other projects.

### vuln_banner.txt

This script is a network vulnerability scanner that checks if a server is vulnerable to specific exploits. It connects to a specified list of IP addresses on predefined ports and captures the server banners. It then compares the banners against a list of known vulnerabilities to identify potential security risks.

Before running the script, ensure that you have the following:
- Python 3 installed
- The socket module available
- The vuln_banners.txt file with a list of known vulnerabilities
